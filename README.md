## Introduction of My Design

### Background of Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD):
Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is a webpage that shares beautiful Astronomy pictures every day. Users can see different and new pictures every day. If people had qualified Astronomy pictures, they could submit their photos, too. NASA will share its pictures on the APOD page. Besides, there was a discussion board to let people who are interested in APOD pictures discuss their pictures. Therefore, APOD is not only sharing astronomy pictures. It also gathers people who are interested in Astronomy and love to photograph photos of the cosmos and stars.

### Pain Points on the current page:
1. The navigation was on the bottom. Users need to scroll down to the bottom to see the navigation.
2. Some information on the Archive page overlapped with the Index and Calendar pages. It seems like the Archive page was redundant.
3. User couldn't filter the information on either the Archive page or Index page because there was not a filter function on the page.
4. The search bar on the Search page is monotonous. It is also inconvenient that users need to go to a different page when looking up pictures or information.
5. The link to submission is not obvious. Users who want to share their photos can hardly find the link.
6. Users didn't know APOD had a mobile app because they couldn't find a download button on this page.
7. If users wanted to share the pictures on their social media, there wasn't a quick sharing button to share this page. 

### Goal for redesigning the APOD page
* Design a **web application** to improve the user experience. Help users find the information more easily.
* Guide users to action pages such as the Submission and Search page.
* Optimize the information architecture, so users can understand how the page works.

### Design Decision
1. Depending on different devices, make a navigation bar of action items stick to the sidebar or bottom, so users can find the action items they want at a glance.
2. Group the site links of information to a menu button and put it at the top.
3. Add links for downloading the APOD App to the menu.
4. Combine the Archive page into the Calendar page and rename the page to Album.
5. Rename the Index page to Categories. Users can find each category by clicking on the toggle items of Categories.
6. Design an advanced filter on the Search for Pictures page. 
7. Add action buttons to each page to guide users on what they can do after seeing the picture on the APOD page.
8. Add a sharing button to the picture page. Therefore, users can share the photo on their social media immediately.
